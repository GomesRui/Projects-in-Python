- Prototype to apply a distance calculation algorithm deployed in a Raspberry Pi Zero

It has 3 modes: Off, Hold and Active;

Advantages:
Customizable (precision, range and speed of response)
Calculates distance at long ranges
Effective;
Adaptable to integrate other solutions;
Error of distance measurement only around 1cm to 2cm (1-2% of percentage error) for small distances (until 1 meter).

Limitations:
Not portable;
Structure a bit clumsy;
Sensor range limitation (only acceptable between 2cm to 30m);
The higher the distance, the higher the error measurement might be.
